      <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
      <p className="subtitle">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>BAE is built on one simple belief: real human connection matters. These guidelines exist to keep BAE a space where people feel safe, respected, and free to be themselves. Every person you meet on BAE is a real human with real feelings. Treat them accordingly.</p>

      <h2>Be Real</h2>
      <p>BAE is a no-filter zone. There are no profile photos, no curated highlight reels, and no algorithms deciding who you should meet. Just real people showing up as they are. We expect you to do the same.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use your real first name</li>
        <li>Be honest about your location</li>
        <li>Add interests that genuinely reflect who you are</li>
        <li>Show up as your authentic self on video</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Be Kind</h2>
      <p>You&apos;re meeting real people from all over the world. Different backgrounds, different cultures, different perspectives. That&apos;s what makes BAE special.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Treat every person with respect and dignity</li>
        <li>Be open to conversations you didn&apos;t expect</li>
        <li>If you&apos;re not vibing with someone, use the Next button — don&apos;t be rude about it</li>
        <li>Remember: behind every screen is a real person</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Be Safe</h2>
      <p>Your safety is our priority. But safety is a shared responsibility.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Never share personal information like your phone number, address, or financial details during a video call</li>
        <li>Trust your instincts — if something feels off, end the call</li>
        <li>Report any behavior that makes you uncomfortable</li>
        <li>Block users who violate these guidelines</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Zero Tolerance</h2>
      <p>The following will result in immediate and permanent removal from BAE:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nudity or sexually explicit behavior during video calls</li>
        <li>Harassment, bullying, threats, or intimidation of any kind</li>
        <li>Hate speech, racism, sexism, homophobia, or any form of discrimination</li>
        <li>Any involvement of minors — BAE is strictly 18+</li>
        <li>Recording or capturing other users&apos; video or audio without consent</li>
        <li>Impersonating another person</li>
        <li>Spam, solicitation, or commercial activity</li>
        <li>Any illegal activity</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Report</h2>
      <p>If you experience or witness any violation of these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the report feature within the app during or after a match</li>
        <li>Email us at <a href="mailto:support@baewithme.com">support@baewithme.com</a> with details of the incident</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We review all reports and take appropriate action. Depending on the severity, this may include a warning, temporary suspension, or permanent ban. We may also cooperate with law enforcement when necessary.</p>

      <h2>The BAE Promise</h2>
      <p>We built BAE because we believe the world needs more real connection and less superficial scrolling. Every time you open BAE, you have the opportunity to brighten someone&apos;s day, discover a new interest, or meet someone who changes your perspective.</p>
      <p>BAE is for the World. Help us keep it a place worth being.</p>
