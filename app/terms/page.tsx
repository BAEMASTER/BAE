      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p className="subtitle">Last updated: February 2026</p>

      <p>Welcome to BAE (&quot;Best App Ever&quot;), operated by BAE Technologies LLC (&quot;BAE,&quot; &quot;we,&quot; &quot;us,&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). BAE is an interest-based video connection platform that matches real people through shared interests for live, unfiltered conversations.</p>
      <p>By accessing or using BAE through our website at baewithme.com or any associated applications (the &quot;Platform&quot;), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (&quot;Terms&quot;). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use BAE.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account or use BAE. By using the Platform, you represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms. We reserve the right to request proof of age at any time and to terminate accounts that violate this requirement.</p>

      <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
      <p>To use BAE, you must create an account using Google OAuth authentication. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during registration, including your first name, last name, and general location (city and state). You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and for all activities that occur under your account.</p>
      <p>Your public display name will show your first name and last initial only (e.g., &quot;Jason R.&quot;) to protect your privacy. Your full last name is never displayed publicly on the Platform.</p>

      <h2>3. How BAE Works</h2>
      <p>BAE is a live video connection platform. When you use BAE, you may experience the following features:</p>
      <p><strong>Random Video Matching.</strong> BAE connects you with other users for live, real-time video conversations. Matches are random and are not algorithmically curated based on your interests.</p>
      <p><strong>Interest Profiles.</strong> You create a profile by adding your interests, passions, professional skills, favorite places, and more. During a video match, shared interests between you and your match partner are highlighted.</p>
      <p><strong>Interest Discovery and Teleportation.</strong> During a live video match, you may discover your match partner&apos;s interests and choose to add (&quot;teleport&quot;) any of their interests to your own profile.</p>
      <p><strong>Vibe Meter and MEGAVIBE.</strong> The Vibe Meter tracks the number of shared interests between you and your match partner. When you reach a threshold of shared interests, a MEGAVIBE celebration is triggered. This celebration occurs only once per unique pair of users.</p>
      <p><strong>Saving Profiles.</strong> You may save the profiles of users you connect with for future reference. Saved profiles include the source of the connection (e.g., &quot;Met on video&quot; or &quot;Found exploring&quot;).</p>
      <p><strong>Explorer.</strong> The Explorer feature allows you to browse other BAE users&apos; interest profiles, discover potential connections, and save profiles of interest.</p>

      <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>BAE is built for authentic, respectful human connection. By using the Platform, you agree to the following:</p>
      <p>You will NOT:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use BAE if you are under 18 years of age</li>
        <li>Engage in any form of harassment, bullying, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior</li>
